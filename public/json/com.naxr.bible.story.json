One day while sending his sheep to graze in the pastures\nThat\\'s when he realized that one of his sheep was missing\nSo he left the remaining ninety-nine sheep in the open country,\nAnd went after the one sheep that was lost \nHe went through out the country side and the pastures\nHe searched for the sheep far and wide, until he found it.\nFinally he spots the lost sheep in a distant place\nWhen he finally gets the lost sheep in his hands, he becomes very happy\nAfter he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.\nAnd when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, \u2018Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.\u2019\nJust so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance",

And the whole crowd stood on the beach. \nAnd he told them many things in parables, saying: Once a sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, \nAs he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, it was trampled on and the birds ate it up.\nOther seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up.\nSince they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away.\nOther seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. \nStill other seed fell on good soil. It came up and yielded a crop.\nSome a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. When he said this, he called out, \u201cWhoever has ears to hear, let them hear.\u201d \nHis disciples asked him what this parable meant. He said, \u201cThe knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,\n\u201cthough seeing, they may not see, though hearing, they may not understand. \u201cThis is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. \nThose along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. \nThose on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away.\nThe seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life\u2019s worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. \nBut the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop. \nHe indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.\u201d",

Surely he would help the wounded man.\nNo! When he saw the man bleeding, he passed by on the other side of the road.\nSoon the pad of feet announced the approach of another person.\nHe was a Levite, a man who helped the priests at the temple.\nHe went and looked at the hurt man, then walked away without helping.\nFinally a Samaritan man came along. Jewish people hated Samaritans. People listening to Jesus story would not expect a Samaritan to be the hero.\nBut he was. The Samaritan cared, and stopped to help.\nThe Samaritan kneeled, and gently put medicine and bandages on the stranger\\'s wounds.\nThen he helped the hurt man onto his own donkey.\nAt a roadside inn, the Samaritan took care of the man all night.\nIn the morning he paid the innkeeper to care for the traveler until he was well again.\nFinally he told him, \"Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.\" \nThe story ended. Jesus asked, \"Who was neighbor to the hurt man? \"The lawyer answered, \"His neighbor was the Samaritan who showed mercy.\"\n\"Go, and do likewise,\" Jesus said. A neighbor is anybody in need. We can show love by helping people in need. That pleases God.",
